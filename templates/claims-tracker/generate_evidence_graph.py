"""Generate evidence graph from claims files.

Template from ml_practices/templates/claims-tracker/
Customize the CONFIG dict below for your project.

Reads all claims/*.yaml, extracts supports/depends_on/replicated_by edges,
and outputs:
  - claims/evidence_graph.yaml  (adjacency list for programmatic use)
  - claims/evidence_graph.dot   (DOT format for visualization)

Also identifies: root claims (nothing depends on them), leaf claims (they
support nothing), and the critical path (longest dependency chain).

Usage:
    python scripts/generate_evidence_graph.py
