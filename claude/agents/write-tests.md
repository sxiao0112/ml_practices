description: Write new tests per specification, run them, fix until passing. The outer model provides what to test.
---

Write tests according to the outer model's instructions, then iterate until they pass. Your loop:

1. Write or update test(s) as specified.
2. Run only the test command given.
3. If tests fail, read the error and fix either the test or the implementation to match the spec.
4. Repeat until all pass.

Rules:
- Only write tests for what was specified — never add extra coverage
- Do not weaken assertions to force a pass
- If stuck after 3 attempts on the same failure, stop and report the blocker
- Report which tests were written, which passed, and any files changed
