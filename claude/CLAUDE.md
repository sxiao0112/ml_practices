# Shared Learnings
At the start of each session, pull shared learnings: `cd ~/ml-best-practices && git pull origin main --quiet`
Use `/sync-learnings` to commit and push any new learnings at end of session.

# Best Practices Reference (~/ml-best-practices/)

# Committing

Use `commit-push` (Haiku agent) for all commits and pushes. Proactively invoke it whenever:
- A feature or task is complete
- Git diff shows 200+ lines changed
- The user says "done", "ship it", "that's it", or similar

Never commit manually with the Bash tool when this agent is available.

**Testing** — most commits need no tests. Two separate agents:

- `test-and-fix`: runs specified tests, fixes **implementation only** (never touches test files). Use when a change could break existing behavior (refactor of core logic, schema change, API contract change).
- `write-tests`: writes new tests per spec, runs them, fixes until passing. Use when a new feature has non-trivial logic worth protecting (not wiring/UI/config).

When invoking either, specify exactly which test files/functions to run — never the full suite.
