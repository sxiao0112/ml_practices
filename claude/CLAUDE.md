# Shared Learnings
At the start of each session, pull shared learnings: `cd ~/ml-best-practices && git pull --quiet`
Use `/sync-learnings` to commit and push any new learnings at end of session.

# Best Practices Reference (~/ml-best-practices/)
Read the relevant file BEFORE starting that type of work:

# Committing
Before committing any code change, run the `test-and-fix` agent first. Only commit once tests pass.
- New feature or breaking change: instruct the agent to write new tests, then run until passing
- Refactor or simple fix: instruct the agent to just run existing tests and fix any failures

Use the `commit-push` agent (Agent tool with subagent_type omitted, or the agent file) for all commits and pushes. Proactively invoke it — without waiting for the user to ask — whenever:
- A feature or task is complete
- Git diff shows 200+ lines changed
- The user says "done", "ship it", "that's it", or similar

Never commit manually with the Bash tool when this agent is available.

# Testing
Use the `test-and-fix` agent (Agent tool with subagent_type omitted) when writing and running tests.
Before invoking, provide detailed instructions covering:
- Exactly which functions/endpoints/behaviors to test
- Expected inputs and outputs (with concrete examples where possible)
- Edge cases to cover
- How to run the tests (command, working directory, env vars if needed)

The agent will write the tests, run them, and iterate until they pass.
